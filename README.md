An Analysis of the Effectiveness of Blockchain Technology and Sentiment Analysis as Solutions to Misinformation

# Abstract
In today’s fast paced world of technology with access to real-time news and instant information, it is no surprise that misinformation has become a growing issue. Many solutions to this problem have been presented, but one common issue is that each working solution today, in some form or another, depends on human trust to identify the truth of the online media.  This study intends to find an automated solution to misinformation that prevents the need for reliance on others to identify ‘fake news’.  Several technologies, including blockchain and sentiment analysis, are analyzed and tested to work towards finding a viable algorithm.  The results of these tests are recorded, solutions have been ruled out, and future work is planned in accordance with encouraging progress.  Much work must still be completed to provide a complete working system, but there is still optimism that the identification of misinformation can become a trustless system.  

This repository contains datasets and files used for tests and analysis of sentiment analysis for this project.
